# Recipe Application

This application is being developed during studying ruby on rails. Later, I 
suppose, it still be there for a while until it'll switch to a blog.
(The course is https://www.udemy.com/pro-ruby-on-rails-rails5/learn/v4/overview)

Requirements:

* Ruby version 2.3.4

* Rails 5.1.4

* System dependencies - read the Gemfile

* Database (sqlite for development and postgresql for production)

* All methods are covered with tests and they can be run using cli command
$ rails test
